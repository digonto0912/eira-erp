1. in general page w.o. items editing time buttton come [save, delete]. if in this time you click delete that time this row delete but after delete start a problem that is - next row start editing, and show deleted row value's in this next row.

solution: now make when editing is {true}. that time never show delete button, show cancel button but when click in cancel start reloading the page.

2. never removing general page original code for risk ignoring purpose. remove before production.
